            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <p>Rallying or 'rally' is a form of racing on either public or private roads with small, compact cars. Unlike most auto racing types, rally is from point A to B, instead of a 
            circuit. Each driver has a co-driver. It is the job of the co-driver to read the pacenotes to the driver so he knows what to expect around
            each corner.</p>
            <p>
                The drivers race on tracks called 'stages'. In a single race there can
                be anywhere from 10 to 18 stages. Some stages are at night, others in the early morning.
                Stages can consist of tarmac, asphalt, dirt, mud, and sometimes even snow!
                
            </p>
            <p>
                To win a rally, you must have the combined fastest time of all the stages. Often, Rallies are won by a matter of minutes.
                Something like spinning out in a corner, could cost you the entire event.
